A SageMath-based computing environment for binder
=================================================

.. image:: https://beta.mybinder.org/badge.svg
   :target: https://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/sagemath/sage-binder-env/master?filepath=index.ipynb

This repository illustrates Binder use cases for
`SageMath <http://sagemath.org>`_.

.. TOPIC:: What is `Binder <http://mybinder.org>`_?

    Have a repository full of Jupyter notebooks? With `Binder
    <http://mybinder.org>`_, you can add a badge that opens those
    notebooks in an executable environment, making your code
    immediately reproducible by anyone, anywhere.

.. TOPIC:: What is `SageMath <http://sagemath.org>`_?

    A general purpose, community developed open source software for
    computational mathematics.

Demo notebooks
--------------

This repository provides some simple live demos for SageMath and other
software included in the SageMath distribution.

- `index.ipynb <index.ipy>`_: starter notebook / brief SageMath demo
- `demo-gap.ipynb <demo-gap.ipynb>`_: brief GAP demo
- `demo-pari.ipynb <demo-pari.ipynb>`_: brief Pari/GP demo
- `demo-singular.ipynb <demo-singular.ipynb>`_: brief Singular demo

.. TOPIC:: TODO

    Develop a collection of striking demo notebooks, and link from
    `http://sagemath.org/`, maybe as try.sagemath.org.

Example of binder-enabled repository for SageMath
-------------------------------------------------

Have a repository full of Jupyter notebooks using SageMath? It's easy
to setup Binder to let anyone run them. Just copy the short
`Dockerfile <Dockerfile>`_ from this repository, and adapt it to your needs. You
probably also want to insert the Binder badge in your `README`.

## Computing backend for live documents (Thebe)

Have HTML pages (e.g. documentation) containing chunks of Sage code?
With `Thebe <https://github.com/minrk/thebelab>`_, it's easy to turn
them into live code cells that will use Binder and the executable
environment defined by this repository.

See this `Thebe example <https://minrk.github.io/thebelab/prompts.html>`_.

For the Sphinx-generated documentation of a SageMath based project,
you can use the Sphinx extension provided by the
`Sage package authoring utilities <https://github.com/sagemath/sage-package>`_.
For an example, see the
`short graphics demo <http://more-sagemath-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mocksage/plot/demo.html>`_
of
`More SageMath tutorials <http://more-sagemath-tutorials.readthedocs.io/>`_,
and click `Activate`.

Note: `Thebe` is similar in principle to `SageMath Cell <http://sagecell.sagemath.org/>`_.
It introduces additional flexibility by enabling the customization of
the programming language (kernel), computing backend (e.g. local
Jupyter server, ...) and executable environment (e.g. via Binder).
It also targets a much broader community, with the potential to
relieve the SageMath community from maintaining a custom solution.
On the other hand it's still relatively recent and quickly evolving
technology with less settled sustainability.

The demo notebooks for GAP, Singular, and Pari were written by the
authors of the respective kernels. See the
`report on their implementation <https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/tree/master/WP4/D4.4>`_.
